# servo-sweep-arduino
This project demonstrates a basic servo motor sweep using an Arduino Uno. The servo rotates smoothly from 0° to 180° and back, controlled via the Servo library.  It’s a great beginner project to understand how to control servo motors using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signals with Arduino.
